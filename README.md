## Laravel Docker 7.2

Simple Dockerfile which takes the wonderful [docker-laravel](https://github.com/mtmacdonald/docker-laravel) image and modifies it to use php 7.2 instead of 7.0. (Technically it builds off of the 7.1 image and just adds 7.2 packages)

## TODO:

* Make 7.3 work when it's also done!
